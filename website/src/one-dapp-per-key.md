# One-Dapp-per-Key<sup>&reg;</sup>

When you add a dapp to your account, a new key is generated just for this dapp.
Wallet addresses are never connected to dapps.  This isolation

- prevents **phishing** &#127907;
- mitigates damage from compromised dapps &#129399;
- enables **automated transaction approval** &#129395;

You can read more about how the One-Dapp-per-Key method works under the hood in
the [technical documentation.](./dev-docs/design/one-dapp-per-key.md)

## Dapp Address

A dapp address is just like a wallet address. You can send and receive tokens with it.

## Transfer Funds

SealVault makes it easy to transfer funds between your wallet and dapp
addresses. You can configure sending a small amount of native tokens
automatically to each newly added dapp address for transaction fees.
